# ShareClick vs Barrier

> Barrier is no longer maintained. ShareClick is an actively developed
> alternative for encrypted Mac-to-Windows keyboard, mouse, clipboard and file
> sharing.

Barrier was a widely used open-source software KVM, but its official release page
says it is **no longer maintained** and no longer receives improvements or
security fixes. ShareClick is a separate, actively developed alternative for
encrypted Mac-to-Windows input, clipboard and file sharing.

Status checked against the [official Barrier release page](https://github.com/debauchee/barrier/releases)
on **August 22, 2026**.

| Feature | ShareClick | Barrier |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Price | Free & open source | Free & open source |
| Project status | **Active, pre-release** | Unmaintained |
| Encryption | **On by default (X25519 + ChaCha20)** | SSL support |
| Clipboard | Text + images | Supported |
| File transfer | **Yes** | No |
| Auto discovery | **mDNS (no IPs)** | Manual IP setup |
| Input transport | **UDP, ~6 µs** | TCP |
| Mac & Windows | Yes | Yes |

## Why maintenance status matters

A software KVM captures keyboard and mouse input and may read sensitive clipboard
content. An unmaintained build can continue working, but users should not expect
compatibility fixes for new macOS or Windows releases or patches for newly
reported security issues. Barrier's own release page directs users toward Input
Leap; the Input Leap repository was later archived in July 2026.

Existing Barrier users do not need to panic or uninstall a working setup
immediately. For a new installation, however, maintenance status should be part
of the decision alongside platform support and features.

## Feature and architecture differences

Barrier follows the classic Synergy client/server model and supports macOS,
Windows and Linux. ShareClick currently focuses on macOS and Windows and is still
pre-release. ShareClick separates low-latency UDP input from reliable clipboard
and file traffic, encrypts both channels and uses mDNS for discovery.

Barrier remains broader for older Linux setups. ShareClick adds clipboard images
and a dedicated file-transfer path, but it does not yet replace Barrier for users
who require Linux. Deskflow is another maintained open-source option worth
evaluating for that use case.

## The short version

**Barrier is unmaintained.** ShareClick provides the same basic
one-keyboard-and-mouse workflow for Mac and Windows, with active development,
encryption on every channel, file transfer, clipboard images and mDNS discovery.

## Moving from Barrier to ShareClick

ShareClick cannot import a Barrier configuration because the applications use
different protocols and layout formats. Install ShareClick on both computers,
pair them and recreate the physical screen arrangement. Approve macOS
Accessibility and Input Monitoring and allow the Windows firewall rule before
testing keyboard, clipboard and file transfer.

Keep Barrier installed until the new setup works with your keyboard layout and
monitor arrangement. If Linux is part of the desk, compare Deskflow and Lan Mouse
before choosing a replacement.
