# Universal Control for Windows: ShareClick vs Apple Universal Control

> Apple Universal Control does not support Windows. ShareClick provides a free,
> open-source Mac-to-Windows alternative with keyboard, mouse, clipboard and file
> sharing over an encrypted local connection.

Apple's **Universal Control** lets one keyboard and mouse move across supported
Macs and iPads, but it does not support Windows. ShareClick is a free,
open-source **Universal Control for Windows alternative** for a Mac and Windows
PC, with clipboard and file sharing over an encrypted local connection.

Apple platform support checked against the [official Universal Control documentation](https://support.apple.com/en-us/102459)
on **August 22, 2026**.

## Why Universal Control does not work with Windows

Universal Control is an operating-system feature tied to supported Apple
devices, the same Apple Account, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi and Handoff requirements.
Apple does not provide a Windows client. Installing iCloud for Windows does not
add Universal Control.

A cross-platform software KVM solves a similar interaction problem at the
network level. ShareClick runs on both computers, captures input on the active
machine and sends it to the paired machine when the pointer crosses a configured
display edge.

## Setup and account requirements

Universal Control is nearly invisible when the Apple prerequisites are already
in place: the devices use the same Apple Account and Apple configures the
connection. ShareClick does not require an Apple Account, Microsoft account or
ShareClick cloud account. The computers pair on the LAN, exchange their monitor
arrangement and authenticate the encrypted connection.

ShareClick requires installation and operating-system permissions on both
machines. On macOS that includes Accessibility and Input Monitoring; Windows may
request a firewall rule. This is more setup than a built-in Apple feature, but it
crosses the platform boundary.

## Clipboard and file movement

Both approaches let users move work between screens, but compatibility differs.
ShareClick synchronizes clipboard text and images between Mac and Windows and
transfers files over a reliable encrypted channel. Universal Control supports
Apple workflows between compatible apps and devices. Neither product streams the
display: each device continues using its own screen.

## Which should you pick?

- **Choose ShareClick** if one machine is a **Windows PC**. Universal Control
  does not support Windows.
- **Choose Universal Control** if you only move between supported **Apple
  devices** and already meet Apple's account and connectivity requirements.

Universal Control is the better fit inside a supported all-Apple setup because
it is built into the operating system. ShareClick addresses the missing
Mac-to-Windows case with clipboard sync, file transfer, encryption on every
channel and a dedicated UDP input path. ShareClick is pre-release software, so
test permissions, keyboard layout and display arrangement on the exact machines
you plan to use.
