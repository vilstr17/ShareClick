# ShareClick — share one keyboard & mouse across Mac and Windows

> Free, open-source software KVM. One keyboard, mouse, clipboard and files
> across a Mac and a Windows PC over your LAN. Encrypted, low-latency, no cloud.

ShareClick is a free, open-source **software KVM**. It lets one keyboard and mouse
control both a Mac and a Windows PC over your local network, with clipboard (text
and images) and file sharing built in. Every channel is end-to-end encrypted
(X25519 key exchange + ChaCha20-Poly1305) and it runs LAN-only — no hardware, no
cloud, no account. It is a free alternative to Synergy, ShareMouse, Barrier and
Input Leap, with a low-latency UDP input path (~6 µs measured loopback transport overhead).
