# 7 Synergy alternatives compared for 2026

The right **Synergy alternative** depends on your operating systems and whether
you need clipboard sync, file transfer, Linux support or a commercial support
contract. This comparison covers seven current and legacy options without
pretending that one tool is best for every desk.

Reviewed against official product pages and repositories on **August 22, 2026**.

## How to choose a Synergy alternative

Start with platform support. A Windows-only utility is a strong option for four
Windows PCs but irrelevant to a Mac-and-Windows desk. Then decide whether you
only need keyboard and mouse input or also expect clipboard images and file
transfer. Finally, check maintenance, encryption defaults and whether you need
paid support.

- **Mac + Windows, free and open source:** ShareClick or Deskflow.
- **Mac + Windows, polished commercial product:** ShareMouse or Synergy.
- **Windows only:** Mouse Without Borders in Microsoft PowerToys.
- **Linux is essential:** Deskflow or Lan Mouse.
- **Existing Barrier or Input Leap user:** Keep archive status and security maintenance in mind before starting a new deployment.

## 1. ShareClick

**ShareClick** is a free, open-source software KVM focused on sharing a mouse,
keyboard, clipboard and files between macOS and Windows. Input uses a low-latency
UDP path; clipboard and files use a reliable channel. Both channels are
end-to-end encrypted, and mDNS discovery avoids manual IP entry.

The trade-off is maturity and platform breadth. ShareClick is currently
pre-release and does not yet offer production Linux support or commercial
support. It fits developers and power users who want an inspectable, LAN-only
Mac-to-Windows tool and are comfortable testing an actively developed
open-source project.

## 2. Deskflow

[Deskflow](https://github.com/deskflow/deskflow) is the mature open-source
continuation of the original Synergy 1 codebase. It shares keyboard, mouse and
clipboard across Windows, macOS, Linux and BSD, with TLS enabled by default. Its
platform coverage and established codebase make it the safer open-source choice
when Linux support is required.

Choose Deskflow when broad operating-system support matters more than
ShareClick's focused Mac-to-Windows file-transfer and low-latency design. As with
any cross-platform input tool, verify packaging and Wayland support for the Linux
distribution you actually use.

## 3. ShareMouse

[ShareMouse](https://www.sharemouse.com/) is a commercial Mac-and-Windows product
with bidirectional control, clipboard sharing and polished file drag and drop.
Its official feature list includes display management, synchronization features
and remote login capabilities that go beyond a minimal software KVM.

A restricted freeware mode exists, while professional use, larger display
arrangements and advanced features require a paid edition under ShareMouse's
current policy. Choose ShareMouse when polish and commercial product support
justify the license. Choose an open-source option when licensing cost, source
access or unrestricted personal layouts matter more.

## 4. Mouse Without Borders

[Mouse Without Borders](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/powertoys/mouse-without-borders)
is part of Microsoft PowerToys. It controls up to four Windows computers with
one keyboard and mouse and supports clipboard sharing and file transfer. For a
Windows-only desk, it is free, familiar and backed by the PowerToys project.

It does not solve Mac-to-Windows input sharing. If even one computer is a Mac,
use a cross-platform tool instead. That platform boundary is the main decision,
not a small feature difference.

## 5. Lan Mouse

[Lan Mouse](https://github.com/feschber/lan-mouse) is an open-source Rust project
focused on mouse and keyboard sharing across Linux, Windows and macOS. It is
particularly relevant to Linux and Wayland users who want a small input-sharing
tool.

Lan Mouse intentionally does not provide the broader clipboard and file workflow
offered by full software KVM suites. Choose it when input sharing is the
requirement. Choose ShareClick, Deskflow, ShareMouse or Mouse Without Borders
when clipboard transfer is part of the job.

## 6. Input Leap

[Input Leap](https://github.com/input-leap/input-leap) was created by active
Barrier maintainers and supported Windows, macOS, Linux and BSD. Its feature set
centers on keyboard, mouse and clipboard sharing. The repository was archived on
July 26, 2026, and is now read-only.

That does not make existing installations stop working, but archive status
matters for new deployments: fixes, security maintenance and future
operating-system compatibility are no longer expected from that repository.
Existing users should monitor successor projects and migration options.

## 7. Barrier

[Barrier](https://github.com/debauchee/barrier) was a widely used free Synergy
fork. Its official release page now states that Barrier is no longer maintained
and no longer receives improvements or security fixes. The project directed
users toward Input Leap, which has since also been archived.

Barrier remains useful context because many older tutorials recommend it. For a
new setup, select a maintained project instead. Software that captures keyboard
input and clipboard data should not be treated like an unchanging utility.

## Bottom line

- **Choose ShareClick** for a free, encrypted Mac + Windows setup with clipboard images and file transfer, if pre-release software is acceptable.
- **Choose Deskflow** for a mature open-source tool with Linux support.
- **Choose ShareMouse or Synergy** when a commercial product and support are priorities.
- **Choose Mouse Without Borders** when every computer runs Windows.
