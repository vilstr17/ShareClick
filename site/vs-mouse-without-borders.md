desk workflow when one computer is a **Mac**, with encrypted clipboard and file
sharing over the local network.

| Works on Windows | Yes | Yes |
| Open source | Yes (MIT / Apache) | Yes (PowerToys) |
| Clipboard (text + images) | Yes | Yes |
| File transfer | Yes | Yes |
| Pairing security | X25519 + ChaCha20 encryption | Security key + computer name |
| Auto discovery | **mDNS (no IPs)** | Security key + machine names |
| Input transport | **UDP, ~6 µs** | Network transport |

## The platform decision

Mouse Without Borders is a direct fit when every computer runs Windows 10 or
Windows 11. It is integrated into PowerToys, supports up to four computers and
includes clipboard and file transfer. There is no macOS client, so it cannot
bridge a Mac and PC.

ShareClick currently supports macOS and Windows and is designed around a
two-platform desk. It is an independent pre-release project rather than a
Microsoft utility. That gives users an inspectable open protocol and
cross-platform support, while Mouse Without Borders offers the maturity and
distribution of PowerToys.

## Clipboard and files

Both tools move more than input. Microsoft documents clipboard sharing and file
transfer between connected Windows computers. ShareClick synchronizes clipboard
text and images between Mac and Windows and sends files through a separate
reliable encrypted channel.

## Setup differences

Mouse Without Borders pairs Windows machines using a security key and computer
name inside PowerToys. ShareClick advertises devices over mDNS, authenticates the
pair and exchanges the screen arrangement. Both require local firewall access
and work best when the computers can reach each other directly on the same LAN.

## Which should you pick?

- **Choose ShareClick** if either machine is a **Mac**. Mouse Without Borders has
  no macOS client.
- **Choose Mouse Without Borders** if **all** machines run Windows and you want
  PowerToys integration and support for up to four PCs.

Mouse Without Borders is the straightforward free choice for Windows-only desks.
ShareClick brings the same one-keyboard-and-mouse idea to Mac and Windows, with a
dedicated UDP input path, encryption on every channel and mDNS discovery.
ShareClick's ~6 µs measurement is loopback transport overhead, not a direct
end-to-end benchmark against the Microsoft tool.
