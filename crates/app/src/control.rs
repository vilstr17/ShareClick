//! Shared control state between the capture thread and the network pump.
//!
//! SYMMETRIC (ShareMouse-style) model: both machines always capture their own
//! input AND inject the peer's. Exactly one pointer is "away" at a time:
//!
//!  * `my_away`   — MY pointer crossed onto the peer's screen: my physical
//!    input is suppressed locally and forwarded; my cursor is hidden/parked.
//!  * `peer_away` — the PEER's pointer is on MY screen: their forwarded input
//!    is injected here and drives my real cursor. My own physical input still
//!    works locally (local-first, inputs merge like ShareMouse).
//!
//! Capture flips these on edge hits / hotkeys; the network pump diff-detects
//! and sends the matching `PointerEnter` / `PointerEnd` messages.
