<h1>ShareClick</h1>

**A low-latency, open-source software KVM.** Move one keyboard & mouse — plus the
clipboard and files — between your **macOS** and **Windows** machines over the
LAN, end-to-end encrypted, with the lowest input lag we can squeeze out.

A free **alternative to Synergy, ShareMouse, Barrier and Input Leap**, the
Mac-capable answer to **Mouse Without Borders**, and effectively **Universal
Control for Windows**.

- **One keyboard & mouse** — push your cursor across the screen edge to control the other machine.
- **Shared clipboard** — copy on one machine, paste on the other (text + images).
- **Drag-and-drop files** — reliable, chunked transfer between machines.
- **End-to-end encrypted** — X25519 + a shared passphrase + ChaCha20-Poly1305. LAN-only, no cloud, no accounts.
- **Latency-first** — dedicated UDP input path, ~6 µs one-way transport overhead.

## Install

**macOS (Homebrew)**
```bash
brew install --cask phun333/tap/shareclick
```

**Windows (Scoop)**
```powershell
scoop install https://raw.githubusercontent.com/phun333/ShareClick/main/packaging/scoop/shareclick.json
```

Or grab the installer from the [**Releases**](https://github.com/phun333/ShareClick/releases) page.

> **Note:** builds are **unsigned** (no paid Apple/Microsoft certificate), so your OS
> shows a one-time warning. Follow the
> [installation docs](https://shareclick.mintlify.app/installation) to review and
> allow the app.

## Try ShareClick

On **both** machines: open ShareClick (menu-bar on macOS, system tray on
Windows) → **Settings & Monitor Manager** → set the **same passphrase** and your
screen layout → save. Then push your mouse into the shared screen edge to jump
across; copy/paste and files sync automatically.
