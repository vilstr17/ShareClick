# Changelog

All notable changes to ShareClick are documented here. The format is based on
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and the project follows
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). See
[docs/RELEASING.md](./docs/RELEASING.md) for the release process.

## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.2] - 2026-09-03

### Fixed
- **Lost mouse with no peer** — edge crossings and the hotkey push are now
  ignored until a peer input session is actually live (`peer_connected` gate).
  Previously touching a bordered edge with no peer connected hid the local
  cursor and parked it with nowhere to go: the pointer "disappeared" on macOS
  and the physical mouse was silently swallowed on Windows until the process
  was killed. With the gate, the cursor simply stays on the home screen and
  the push hotkey logs a warning instead of hiding input.

### Added
- **Personal fork note** — README now identifies this repository as Vilém
  Štrait's version of ShareClick and records the unresolved device-pairing
  issue.
- **Live pairing status in the tray and Settings** — the menu and settings
  window now show setup, discovery, connected, disconnected, and error states,
  the known peer identity, and the next action to take. New configurations use
  the local computer name instead of assuming platform-specific machine names.
  The tray build now always includes that Settings window.
- **Privacy-friendly website analytics** — Umami pageview tracking across the
  GitHub Pages site, with separate release-page click events for macOS, Windows,
  guides, and comparison pages.
- **Search-focused website guides** — an evidence-based 2026 Synergy alternatives
  comparison and a Mac-to-Windows clipboard-sharing guide, plus stronger homepage
  targeting, internal links, metadata, and current sitemap dates.
- **Symmetric control (ShareMouse-style)** — both machines are equals: use
  EITHER machine's mouse & keyboard, whichever you grab. Exactly one pointer is
  "away" at a time; the visited machine's real cursor is driven directly, so
  crossings feel like real adjacent monitors. (Protocol v4.)
- **Zero-config auto-pairing** — both machines advertise + search on the LAN
  and connect automatically: no IPs, no role picking (`shareclick pair`, and
  the default when no role is set).
- **One-machine layout setup** — the monitor arrangement is exchanged in the
  handshake; the other machine adopts the mirrored layout automatically.
- **Real-monitor overlap edges** — crossing only happens where the two screens
  actually overlap (with the arrangement offset); elsewhere the edge is a wall.
- **Fully dynamic screen sizes** — always live-detected, reported in the
  handshake, never typed by hand.
- **Background service** — `shareclick install-service` auto-starts ShareClick
  on login (macOS LaunchAgent / Windows startup), no terminal needed.
- **Server/Client/auto role selector** + no-overlap monitor arrangement UI.
- **Brand icon** everywhere: tray, settings window, site favicon, macOS .app
  icon and the Windows .exe/installer icon.
- **Seamless macOS cursor switching** — while the client has control the local
  Mac cursor is hidden and pinned (Deskflow technique: `SetsCursorInBackground`
  + warp-to-centre + live position), so the pointer truly *leaves* one screen
  and appears on the other instead of mirroring.
- **Visual settings & monitor-arrangement window** (`gui` feature) — drag the two
  monitors to lay them out like macOS Displays; ShareClick computes the edge
  adjacency and saves the config. Opened from the tray **Settings**.
- **Automatic remote screen size** — the client reports its resolution on connect
  (like Deskflow's DINF), so the arrangement window shows the real size.

### Changed
- **Development status and contribution guidance** — the website, README, and
  documentation now explain that compatibility may vary during active
  development and link to bug reports, feedback, and pull requests. GitHub issue
  forms now ask only for the details needed to start triage.

### Fixed
- mDNS advertisements now include the stable device ID used to identify peers.
- Stuck modifier keys (Ctrl/Alt "Alt+Tab" bug) after a control hand-off — all
  modifiers are now released on every switch.
- Windows: hide the stray console window when launched as the tray app.
- Cursor-return edge is now the opposite of the exit edge (fixes not being able
  to return control).

## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-06

First release. A complete, low-latency, open-source software KVM.

### Added
- **Input sharing** — one keyboard & mouse across macOS ⇄ Windows, via rdev
  capture + enigo injection, with a portable cross-platform key mapping.
- **Low-latency transport** — hybrid UDP (input) + TCP (bulk) with sequence
  numbers and per-tick event coalescing; ~6 µs one-way loopback overhead.
- **Real control handoff** — rdev `grab` swallows local input while the client
  has control; F12 toggle plus automatic screen-edge switching in both
  directions (client auto-returns via cursor tracking).
- **Encryption** — X25519 + pre-shared-key handshake + ChaCha20-Poly1305 on both
  channels; measured ~20 ns latency cost.
- **Clipboard sync** — text and images (raw RGBA), with echo suppression.
- **File transfer** — chunked, offset-based, path-traversal-safe (`send-file`,
  received into `./received/`).
- **Settings + monitor manager** — TOML config describing the machine/edge
  layout, PSK, and port (`init-config`).
- **mDNS discovery** — zero-config peer finding (`discover`, or `connect` with no
  host).
- **GUI** — macOS menu-bar status item / Windows system tray (`--features tray`).
- **Installers** — universal macOS `.dmg` and Windows `.exe`, built and published
  by CI on tag. No Rust required for end users.
- **Docs** — full `docs/` set (architecture, protocol, security, development,
  releasing, decisions, history).

### Known limitations
- Builds are unsigned (Gatekeeper/SmartScreen prompt on first launch).
- One client at a time; no sliding-window UDP anti-replay yet.
